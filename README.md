# aiox_monitor_and_reconnect
This is a quick hack to get the buggy router a-wr307n to connect as a client on a wifi network and bridge with its ethernet ports.
Also this script will monitor for wifi connectivity and when disconnected it tries to restablish the connection and restarts the router.
The windows executable is 64bit and was created with py2exe.
Parameters are stored in config.json file.
